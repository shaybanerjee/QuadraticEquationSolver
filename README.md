<h1> QuadraticEquationSolver </h1> 

<p> Built a quadratic equation solver in C# to familiarize myself with the language and with Visual Studio. 
Simple application that uses the equation <b> x = −b ± √(b2 − 4ac) / 2a </b> to provide the roots of quadratic equations. 
This project was going to be added to the StockCalculator application but was left out. </p> 

<b> The application uses: </b><br> 
    - C# <br>
    - Visual Studio <br>
